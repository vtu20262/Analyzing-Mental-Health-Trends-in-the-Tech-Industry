This project aims to analyze employee perspectives on mental health and the prevalence of mental health issues within the tech industry using SQL. The goal is to explore attitudes toward mental health and identify any trends or patterns related to mental health illnesses among employees.
Tools and Technologies:
SQLite Database: Used for managing and querying the employee data.
Python Pandas Library: Utilized for data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis.
Excel: Employed for additional data cleaning and visualization tasks.
3. Methodology
Data Collection: Describe how the employee data was obtained. If itâ€™s simulated data or sourced from a specific database, provide details.
Database Schema: Outline the structure of the SQLite database, including tables, relationships, and key fields relevant to mental health data.
SQL Queries:
Data Retrieval: Examples of queries used to extract relevant data from the database.
Data Filtering: Techniques to filter data based on specific criteria (e.g., mental health status, department, etc.).
Data Analysis: Queries used to aggregate and analyze data (e.g., counts of mental health conditions, average ratings of mental health support, etc.).
4. Data Cleaning and Manipulation
Data Cleaning: Explain the steps taken to clean the data using pandas and Excel. This may include handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies, and standardizing formats.
Data Manipulation: Describe how data was transformed or aggregated to prepare for analysis. This may involve merging tables, creating new variables, or filtering data.
5. Analysis and Findings
Descriptive Statistics: Present basic statistics on mental health data, such as the number of employees with mental health issues, average ratings of mental health support, etc.
Patterns and Trends: Highlight any significant patterns or trends discovered during the analysis. This might include correlations between departments and mental health issues or differences in mental health perceptions based on job roles.
Visualizations: Include charts or graphs to illustrate key findings. Use Excel or pandas visualization tools to create meaningful visual representations of the data.
6. Conclusion
Summary of Findings: Summarize the key insights gained from the analysis. Discuss any implications for mental health support within the tech industry.
Recommendations: Based on the findings, provide recommendations for improving mental health support and awareness in the tech industry.
Future Work: Suggest areas for further research or additional analysis that could be performed to build on this project.
